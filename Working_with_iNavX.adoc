= Setting up iNavX to work with the followOCPN script

:imagesdir: images

For this to work, your device running iNavX needs to receive NMEA data over a WiFi connection via a WiFi router.

[NOTE]
====
Many instrument WiFi gateways that create their own WiFi network are not actual routers.
This is the case, for example, for the Actisense W2K-1 and also the Yacht Devices YDNR-02N.

If your gateway is not also a router, you need a WiFi router and need to connect your gateway as a client of that network.
You could use a 12V-powered WiFi router (readily available) or your computer may be able to provide this.
MacOS can create an _ad hoc_ WiFi network from the WiFi pull-down menu. In Monterey and later, this is hidden unless you enable it in Settings->Network->WiFi->Advanced and tick _Show legacy networks and options_.
I happen to have a USB-powered mini-hub that British Telecom gave me when we were moving house.
This does contain a router.
====

. Have OpenCPN receive NMEA data from your gateway on one port - say 60001
. Have OpenCPN send NMEA data on a different port - say 60002 +
You will need a sending port for each iNavX device you wish to connect. +
Drop outgoing sentences `ECRMB,ECAPB,ECXTE` because the script sends modified sentences using the device identifier configured in the script. See the screenshot the below.

. Determine the IP address of your computer.  On MacOS, System Preferences > Network > WiFi > Advanced > TCP/IP.
. Connect your device to the same WiFi network
. Within iNavX select Instruments  > TCP/IP and on the TCP tab set the Host to the IP address of your computer and port number to as in Step 2 above.
. On the same panel, enable Waypoints and enable Link. +
You should now see green NMEA sentences scrolling in the monitoring pane of this panel.

. Click Done and then select the Chart.

iNavX should now follow the ship's navigation using the ship's navigation data.

[TIP]
====
*Familiarisation and testing at home*

In the absense of a navigational feed you can drive the ship using a simulator.

I use the driver.js script running in a separate console.
You can set a compass course and speed.
You can also set the wind so you can check the wind direction shown in iNavX.

Open an additional console via the Tools button for the Driver script.

See the Driver https://github.com/antipole2/JavaScripts-shared/blob/main/Driver/Driver.adoc[instructions here.]

When a waypoint becomes active in OpenCPN, it becomes active in iNavX.

== Mirroring an OpenCPN route

When a route is activated in OpenCPN, it appears as the active route in iNavX.

As OpenCPN advances the routepoint, so iNavX advances its active routepoint.
Progress along the route is available in the route tab of the ribbon at the top of the iNavX screen,
together with predicted time on route and Estimated Time of Arrival (ETR).  Tapping on the RTN button displays the whole route with distance or times.

If you wish to force an advance to the next routepoint, this should be done in OpenCPN, whereupon iNavX will update too.

[CAUTION]
If you advance the routepoint in iNavX, it will start ignoring changes in the active routepoint sent from OpenCPN.
To restore this, turn Enable Waypoints off and back on again.
[NOTE]
Sometimes the dotted blue line joining the points into a route is not displayed.  See https://github.com/antipole2/FollowOCPN/issues/2[here for details].
[WARNING]
====
Like many navigation packages, iNavX identifies a mark by its name.  OpenCPN identifies it by GUID and different or points can have the same name.  A route created in OpenCPN typically has point names `001, 002, 003` et seq.  If a different route is sent to iNavX using the same point names, the point will be moved to a new location.  This would dangerously invalidate an existing route using that point.

Do not use iNavX to navigate an earlier route without checking.  It is safe to send the earlier route from OpenCPN again.
